Quickstarts

These are the Jomres Quickstarts with ALL the 170+ Core Plugins including open source Plugin Manager v3.3 so your website will never expire. All open source.

Just download all files from a folder above, then double click on the EXE file. It will self extract to its folder.

Jomres is big, and it's powerful. It's extremely flexible and offers a huge variety of ways you can configure it, but unless you're familiar with it, it takes time to learn how to set it up.

These Quickstarts are designed to get you up and running with a complete Jomres site in just minutes. Each file corresponds to one of the following Demo installations (in fact the Quickstarts are used to create those demos).
